# Gesture Recognition using MPU6050

This is a project based on hand gesture detection using the accelerometer and gyroscope values from mpu6050 . The real time sensor data is also plotted in a window while running the program.

The program has two modes
- train_mode
- predict_mode

train mode can be used to add new gestures to the dataset while predict mode is used to predict the gestures (real-time testing)


### motion_tracker.py can be used to plot the 3-D trajectory of the sensor
